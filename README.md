OpenSCAD
========

Repository for my OpenSCAD designs

OpenSCAD is a open-source CAD software that I often call 'CAD for programmers'. Design is all done in a C++ based language that uses 'modules' to create different parts. The basic foundation for everything in OpenScad is cubes, polyhedrons, spheres, and cylinders. These shapes can be added, subtracted, and mixed to design you object. The code is then compiled, rendered and displayed in the program.
